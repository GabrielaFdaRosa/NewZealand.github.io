        <p class="textos2">New Zealand is an archipelago country located in Oceania, southeast of Australia. It lies in the area of greatest tectonic instability in the world: the Pacific Ring of Fire. It is divided into two larger islands (North and South) and other smaller islands, totaling 268 thousand km² of area.</p>
        <p class="textos2">The country has more than 4.8 million inhabitants, who live in large urban centers, such as Auckland, and in the capital, Wellington. With a developed economy based on the tertiary sector, New Zealand has a wide network of infrastructure, providing a good quality of life to its population, and a clean energy matrix.</p>

        <p class="textos2">New Zealand is an island country located in the Pacific, southeast of Australia, and in the northernmost portion of the region, known as Polynesia. It is therefore part of the continent of Oceania. The territory of New Zealand has a total area of 268,107 km², divided into two main islands, named, according to their position, the North Island and the South Island; and on other smaller islands. The national capital, Wellington, is on the North Island.</p>
        <p class="textos2">Average temperatures range between 21 °C and 27 °C in summer, and between 6 °C and 10 °C in winter. The accumulated rainfall in a period of one year is between 300 mm in the most arid locations and 6000 mm in humid cities.</p>
        <p class="textos2">The New Zealand islands have a very irregular and rugged relief, formed predominantly by mountains and plateaus, as well as a wide coastal plain. New Zealand is experiencing phenomena such as volcanism and earthquakes.

     <p class="textos">New Zealand is the third most populous country in Oceania, with 4,861,000 inhabitants. This amount represents just over 9% of the entire population of what is the smallest inhabited continent on planet Earth. The population is not well divided between New Zealand's two largest islands, with about 75% of the country's inhabitants living in the North Island, which includes the original peoples. In all, 16 New Zealand islands are inhabited, out of a total of 600. The majority of New Zealanders, 87% to be precise, live in urban centres.</p>

        <p class="textos2">New Zealand's culture is based on the traditions and customs of the Maori along with the influences brought by European settlers and peoples from other Pacific island territories such as Tonga and Samoa.</p>
        <p class="textos2">The Māori make up 16.5% of the New Zealand population, and the language spoken by them, which is also called Māori, is considered one of the official languages of New Zealand. Currently, there is a movement to rescue and preserve Māori culture in the country, which has resulted in effects such as the growth of the use of the language among the New Zealand population.</p>
        <p class="textos2">Much of New Zealand's culture is derived from European roots and distinctive New Zealand characteristics that evolved from the indigenous Maori environment and culture. The vigour and originality of the arts in New Zealand, in film, opera, music, painting, sculpture, theatre and dance is achieving international recognition.</p>

        <p class="textos2">The tattoos made by them, called Ta Moko, have great importance because they represent not only the culture, but also the identity and heredity of each one. Each drawing tells the story of each person, is an important significator of social standing, knowledge, and eligibility to marry traditionally.</p>
        <p class="textos2">Men received the drawing on their buttocks, faces, and thighs. Women usually do it on their lips and chins, sometimes even on their throats. And for Maori culture, the head is sacred, as it is where they accumulate all the knowledge over time, so the tattoos done on the face end up being the most important to them, and the more tattoos the person has on the face, the more important that person is.</p>

        <p class="textos2">New Zealand was one of the last countries to be inhabited, and that was when the first Europeans arrived in New Zealand in 1642, with a Dutch expedition that landed in the South Island.</p>
        <p class="textos2">The relationship between the Māori and the British was not stable throughout the time, and many conflicts and disagreements were recorded during the second half of the 19th century. This status was strengthened a few years later, and in 1947, through the Statute of Westminster, New Zealand became a sovereign realm of the British Commonwealth.</p>
